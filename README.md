# OSINT Report – Mossaman Commodities & FV Malaga 

This repository contains an OSINT case report created as part of a simulated investigation scenario from the **Basel Institute on Governance’s OSINT Training Course**.

The case centers around a vessel named **FV Malaga**, suspected of illegal fishing and involvement in wildlife trafficking. The scenario provided a fictional but realistic investigative environment to practice open-source research, entity mapping, infrastructure analysis, and report writing.

This investigation is **purely fictional** and was conducted as part of an educational scenario built by the [Basel Institute on Governance](https://learn.baselgovernance.org).  
All characters, companies, and data were provided in the course and are not real.

**Only the final report (detailed findings, conclusion, and recommendations)** was written by me as part of a learning exercise to showcase report writing and analysis skills.
