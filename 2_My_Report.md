## Summary

Ship databases show that the vessel FV Malaga is owned by Mossaman Commodities (MC). Musa Umar is shown as the main contact person on MC's website. The company registry shows that the majority owner of MC is Alpha Imports (Isle of Don).

The ship database shows that MC possesses a second, unknown vessel.'

A post on Twitter implies that Gabriel Tran and Linda Shibuya are owners of Alpha Imports. Research on LinkedIn indicates that both individuals work as low-level employees of Allegro Supplies, Auslandia.

Domain records show that Allegro Supplies is connected to Turnbull Enterprises, Auslandia. Furthermore, Allegro Supplies' CEO Suzana Torres is President of the Board of Turnbull Enterprises. Turnbull Enterprises has been involved in illegal fishing scandals.

Analysis of photos of a seized camera and social media research indicate that the vessel FV Malaga entered waters in the natural reserve zone of Colcouche Islands. It's likely that illegal fishing was conducted in these waters.

Animal and animal parts might be shipped from Oaksby Landing, Fair Islands to Scarcola Piers, Auslandia using containers.

A user who might be Musa Umar advertised the dark web website "Auslandian Delicacies". The website offers animals and parts of endangered species.

## Detailed Findings

Mossaman Commodities' business registry lists the company's address as Ragati Road, 34670 Bigare. The records show that Musa Umar incorporated it and owns 100% shares. In December 2023, the company filed for insolvency. In March 2024, 80% of shares were acquired by Alpha Imports, which is based on the Isle of Don.

Mossaman Commodities' web search shows the official website is mossaman-commodities.mos. It shows Musa Umar(photo included) as the main contact person. 

The ship databases and registry confirm that the vessel FV Malaga is owned by Mossaman Commodities. The following information was also obtained: 
- Flag: Mossaman
- MMSI: 4232561205
- Built: 2007-01
- Gross tonnage: 54
- Last voyage: Arendisa de Mar to Tuca, Pearl Gulf, 2024-09-22
- Width: 24x6m

The ship database also lists a second, unidentified vessel owned by Mossaman Commodities.

The domain used by MC was registered by Turnbull Enterprises, a company based in Auslandia, according to WHOIS Records. Reverse IP lookup results suggest that allegro-supplies.aus is also hosted on the same server, indicating a potential connection between the two entities.

The domain allegro-supplies.aus led to the official website of Allegro Supplies, which lists Suzana Nsonowa Torres as the CEO and provides the address: Main Street 8789898 Balil, Auslandia. Domain records confirm that the Allegro Supplies domain is also registered by Turnbull Enterprises, Auslandia.

A Google search shows the involvement of Turnbull Enterprise in illegal fishing activities in the past. The official website is offline, but the search on the website describes that Turnbull is an integrated agro-industrial and food business. The President of the Board is listed as Suzana Nsonowa Torres.

The archived version of MC's website from 6 January 2024 confirms that Mossaman Commodities was acquired by Alpha Imports. It also links to the company‚Äôs Twitter account: @MossComm. The last public post made by this account was on 19 November 2023. A Wayback Machine snapshot of the Twitter feed from January 8, 2024, mentions Gabriel Tran and Linda Shibuya as representatives of Alpha Imports.

The LinkedIn profiles for Gabriel Tran and Linda Shibuya indicate they are currently employed in low-level roles at Allegro Supplies, Auslandia.

An Instagram search for the hashtag #fvmalaga led to a photo of the ship and a comment by a user @isumar claiming to have been on the ship. The user‚Äôs profile lists their real name as Isabel Umar, most likely the daughter of Musa Umar. The user posted a photo of Musa Umar and additional landscape photos of the trip she supposedly made on the FV Malaga. These photos were posted 47 weeks ago on 30 October 2023.

A Twitter search implies that Isabel Umar uses @isumer as a Twitter handle. She has been an active Twitter user since 2009 with a high number of posts. On 30 October 2023, she posted about a fishing trip with her father. Hashtags used: #pearlgulf, #HartbronForge and #TheBayOfLourlet. Wikipedia entries relating to the hashtags indicate a natural reserve area with strictly limited fishing activities. A post indicates she went back to Mossaman on 2 November 2023.

Yandex reverse image search linked the posted landscape photo to Plagan Hill, Colcouche Islands. According to "Protected Planet", Plagan Hill, Colcouche Islands is located in a maritime protected area and fishing is not allowed in that area. Data from Global Fishing Watch corroborates the findings that the FV Malaga entered the area and was encountered fishing in the area on 30 October 2023. 

The photos recovered from the camera that was seized on the FV Malaga were mostly of landscapes and animals. However, two pictures (a selfie image by a young girl and a shipping container photo) stood out. 

The metadata extracted from the selfie image of a young girl(probably Isabel Umar) in front of a big catch of fish confirms the date (30.10.2023) and location (Plagan Hill, Colcouche Islands). This reinforces the possibility of illegal fishing by FV Malaga inside the reserve.

The photographed container was marked HBLU 0100971, registered to Hapag-Lloyd. Shipping data indicates that this container is currently aboard HMM Balil, owned by MA TAURIA, Isle of Don. The route shows movement from Oaksky Landing (Fair Islands) to Scarcola Piers (Auslandia). This route aligns with the possible trafficking of animal parts.

A Reddit search on Mossaman Commodities yields a 5-year-old post from user "ramuasum" requesting feedback on the design of mossaman-commodities.mos. The mirror of "ramusaum" is "musaumar", suggesting that this account was created and used by Musa Umar. 

In another post written 10/08/2023, the same user advertises a Tor (.onion) website offering Auslandian Delicacies. The website http://fsdktlwiu8hdjksqqt4[...].onion/ offers various animals and parts of endangered species for sale, and payments are accepted via Bitcoin on a public address 1DXHKojZ1abjGoWsVHPDjjxKceHDv82i8H

Initial research shows that to date, 1225 transactions have been made using the address. 2.58 BTC have been received, and 1.27 BTC have been sent to another address. Currently, the address holds about 1.31 BTC.

The investigation has uncovered multiple connections between Mossaman Commodities, Alpha Imports, and Allegro Supplies, with several indicators suggesting involvement in illegal fishing and wildlife trafficking. While OSINT findings provide strong leads, further investigation is required to confirm certain relationships and activities.

## Recommendations

Identify the second vessel listed under Mossaman Commodities in the ship registry. Port authority records, IMO number tracking, or maritime satellite data could provide more information.

Verify the ownership structure of Alpha Imports. The current connection to Gabriel Tran and Linda Shibuya is based on an archived tweet. Access to official corporate filings or shareholder registers in the Isle of Don would strengthen attribution.

Request customs inspection or manifest data related to container HBLU 0100971, especially for its transit from Oaksky Landing to Scarcola Piers. 

Analyse the Bitcoin wallet (1DXHKojZ1abjGoWsVHPDjjxKceHDv82i8H) in more detail using blockchain forensics tools.
